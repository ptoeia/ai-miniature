# MCP Interactive Feedback Rules

1. During any process, task, or conversation, whether asking, responding, or completing stage tasks, must call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced.
2. When receiving user feedback, if feedback content is not empty, must call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced again and adjust behavior based on feedback.
3. Only when user explicitly indicates "end" or "no more interaction needed" can you stop calling MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced, then the process is complete.
4. Unless receiving end command, all steps must repeatedly call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced.
5. Before completing the task, use the MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced to ask the user for feedback.
