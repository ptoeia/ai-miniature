# Creem Next.js + Prisma Template

A **Next.js App Router** template project for integrating [Creem](https://creem.io) with modern web apps. This template demonstrates how to use the [Creem SDK](https://github.com/armitage-labs/creem-sdk) to implement common subscription and payment flows. Use this as a starting point for your own Creem-powered SaaS or product.

> **Note:** This is a template project. We welcome [issues](https://github.com/armitage-labs/creem-template/issues) for new use cases and [pull requests](https://github.com/armitage-labs/creem-template/pulls) to improve the template!

## üìù Introduction

This template provides a ready-to-use integration with Creem, Prisma, and Next.js App Router. It demonstrates:

- Fetching and displaying all products in your Creem account
- Creating checkout sessions for products
- Fulfilling orders based on the purchasing account
- Handling subscription creation, cancellation, and expiration
- Generating customer portal links for clients with active subscriptions

The codebase is modular, uses TypeScript throughout, and leverages modern React patterns with [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
The template is not taking security into account, so please be careful when using any of its code in production.
