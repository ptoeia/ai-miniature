    q: 'What is AI Miniature?',
    a: 'A tilt‑shift powered pipeline that turns your photos into miniature‑style images with sharp subject focus and creamy depth of field.'
  },
  {
    q: 'How is it different from regular image generation?',
    a: 'It is purpose‑built for miniature aesthetics: consistent proportions, depth simulation, color grading, and detail recovery tuned for the toy‑world look.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What can I use the results for?',
    a: 'Social posts, product shots, banners, thumbnails, mood boards, and print. Commercial use is allowed—ensure you own the input rights.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What input photos work best?',
    a: 'Clean, well‑lit images (JPG/PNG/WEBP up to 5 MB). A clear subject with some background context yields the strongest miniature effect.'
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does it take?',
    a: 'Typically 30–90 seconds depending on traffic and quality settings. Higher quality options take longer but preserve more detail.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I control the style?',
    a: 'Yes. Use presets (Classic, Dreamy, Product) or add prompt notes for color mood, lighting, lens feel, and background treatment.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What formats are exported?',
    a: 'High‑resolution JPG or PNG optimised for web and print. Transparency is supported when the operation requires it.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you store my images?',
    a: 'Images are processed securely and retained only to deliver your results. You can delete them anytime from your history.'
  }
