    q: "What is Banana AI?",
    a: "Banana AI is an AI-powered toolkit for generating images from text and editing photos with background removal, object edits, style transfer, and restoration."
  },
  {
    q: "How is it different from traditional editors?",
    a: "Instead of manual masking and layers, you describe changes in plain language. The AI applies edits automatically while you fine-tune with simple controls."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use the results commercially?",
    a: "Yes, you can use outputs in commercial projects unless stated otherwise in your plan. Ensure you own the rights to all inputs and comply with local laws."
  },
  {
    q: "Which models should I choose?",
    a: "Use Standard for quick drafts, Pro for higher fidelity edits, and Max for the best detail or upscales. The UI shows cost and speed for each model."
  },
  {
    q: "What file types and sizes are supported?",
    a: "Upload JPG, PNG, or WEBP up to 5 MB. Exports are JPG or PNG depending on the operation and transparency needs."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you store my images? For how long?",
    a: "Images are processed securely and retained only as needed to deliver your results. You can delete them from your history. See our Privacy Policy for details."
  },
  {
    q: "How are credits billed?",
    a: "Each generation/edit consumes credits based on the task and selected model. Failed jobs are automatically refunded; partial results may incur a reduced cost."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I upload references or keep a consistent style?",
    a: "Yes. Attach reference images and describe the look (e.g., palette, lighting, lens). Reuse prompts and references to maintain brand consistency."
  },
  {
    q: "Does Banana AI support batch processing?",
    a: "Yes. Use batch mode to apply the same prompt or edit to multiple images. Results are queued and returned as a downloadable set."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I report issues or request features?",
    a: "Use the feedback link in the app or contact support. Include your prompt, model, and a screenshot so we can help quickly."
